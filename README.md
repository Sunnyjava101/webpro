# Web Development Project
## **Weather App**

## What is the *Weather App*?

The Weather App is a website where a person can register/login and check the forecast for their location.

The Weather App is not complete. There was a lot more I was looking forward to implement and include. The site for
now allows for a user to register/log in, view/delete/edit profile, and search for forecast in any city. 

## Future plans
__Bugs and issues:__ The front end of the website I am pretty satisfied with but I think there still could be some work 
to be done. The backend is the biggest issue in the site. While for any user, their username and password is stored in the
database via SQL, the other elements such as user city, personal info, and user forecast is not stored. The databases are built already on mySQL, 
I was just not able to complete the backend where anytime the user submitted a form to register their city, it gets stored in the backend and so does 
the forecast. 

My future plans with this site is to mainly fix the backend and make it more secure with the databases. I want to make it where a user can login/register, pick 
their main city so it's forecast is on the homepage everytime they log in, and also a settings/preferences page which will allow them to pick metrics, celsius/farenheit, etc... 

I also might try to implement this through something like __XAMPP__ and __PHP__, something that I used in Software Engineering class. I found PHP to be a fairly easy language to use and also navigating and understanding this project through [PHPmyadmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) would work.
